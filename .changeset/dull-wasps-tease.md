'@belgattitude/http-exception': minor
---

Package moved to @httpx/exception.
 
> ⚠️ Version 1.5.0 will be the last one ! We've **moved** to https://github.com/belgattitude/httpx ⚠️
> 
> 
>
> No breaking changes, just update from `@belgattitude/http-exception` to `@httpx/exception`.
> The change to `httpx` namespace makes it shorter, allow more
> packages to be grouped and eventually will be managed inside a github org.
